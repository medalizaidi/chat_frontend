== Ionic Application

In the previous tutorial inside our Ionic chat app we created 2 screens: On the first screen we picked a name and *join the chat*, on the second screen we show the actual *chatroom with messages*. In this tutorial we are going to modify the first screen, so after setting the nickname we go to another page where we select the chat room from a list, and then in the last screen we will only show messages for that specified chat room.

[NOTE]
====
Before continue with this part, in the console go to `chat-client` folder:

```sh
cd chat-clent
```

=== Adding Models

Before continue it is good idea to add the models to our app, so create next files:

.src/app/models/message.ts
[source,ts,options="nowrap]
----
include::src/app/models/message.ts[]
----

.src/app/models/room.ts
[source,ts,options="nowrap]
----
include::src/app/models/room.ts[]
----

.src/app/models/user.ts
[source,ts,options="nowrap]
----
include::src/app/models/user.ts[]
----

As you can see those files are only interfaces that have the same attributes as the server entities.

NOTE: Even though there is a way to put this models in a separate library and share this library between the server and client we are not going to do it in this tutorial.

=== Joining a Chatroom

So now we need to add a way to select the chat room after setting the nickname. To do that we should modify the file `src/app/pages/home/home.ts` with the next code:

[source,ts,options="nowrap"]
----
include::src/app/pages/home/home.page.ts[]
----
<1> instead setting the nickname in the url-path we save it into the local storage variable so we can use it later.
<2> we redirect the user to the `select-room` page

The template file will be the same, so you can keep the next code:

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
include::src/app/pages/home/home.page.html[]
----

=== Building the Room Selection Functionality

In this page the user will select the chat room he will join, so we need a selection list and a filter box. The first step will be to create the page running next command:


```sh
ionic g page pages/select-room
```

then we modify `select-room.page.html` to contain next code:

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
include::src/app/pages/select-room/select-room.page.html[]
----
<1> In the header we show the title and a search-box which executes the method `searchRoom` whenever user types-in and the debounce time has elapsed.
<2> The content shows the list of rooms filtered by the search box. Whenever the user clicks on any of the items of the list, it will be redirected to the `chat-room` page.
<3> The footer contains a text-box that receive the name of a new chat-room and a plus button which executes the method `addRoom`.

Before modifying the `select-room.page.ts` file, it will be needed to add the `debounce-decorator-ts` package. To do it, run next command at the root directory of `chat-client` app:

```
npm i -s debounce-decorator-ts
```

then we modify `select-room.page.ts` to contain next code:

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
include::src/app/pages/select-room/select-room.page.ts[]
----
<1> In the `constructor` we inject
<2> In the `ngOnInit` method we search for all the rooms
<3> The `searchRoom` method is in charge of searching for rooms in dependence of the parameter `q`. This method calls `roomsService.find` method passing parameter `q` to it. After receiving the rooms list, it fills a local public array to be used by the html template.
<4> The `joinRoom` method navigates to `chat-room/:id`. That `id` parameter is later used in the `chat-room` page.
<5> The `addRoom` method calls `roomsService.save` method which sends the information of the new room to the server. After saving the value, it receives the new value and adds it to the `rooms` local public variable.

=== Modifying the Chat Functionality

To receive new chat messages inside the room we have to listen for `message` socket event which receive the messages from the server.

Whenever we get such a message we simply push the new message to an array of messages. Remember, since now we have a database to save historic data, we are going to load it.

Sending a new message is almost the same as before, we simply emit our event to the server with the right type.

Finally, we also listen to the events of users joining and leaving the room and display a little toast whenever someone comes in or leaves the room. Itâ€™s the same logic again, with the `socket.on()` we can listen to all the events broadcasted from our server!

Go ahead and modify `chat-room.ts`:

[source,ts,options="nowrap"]
----
include::src/app/pages/chat-room/chat-room.page.ts[]
----
<1> We import models and services
<2> We inject services `MessagesService` and `RoomsService` in the constructor
<3> Instead getting `nickname` from url, we now get it from `sessionStorage`.
<4> We get the roomId from the value coming from the route path param.
<5> We emit that the user has entered to the chat-room.
<6> Then we get the full information of the chat-room using `roomsService.findById` method.
<7> After receiving the full chat-room info, we set it in a local public variable to be accessible to the html template.
<8> Then we find all the messages of the chat-room using query: `{where: JSON.stringify({room: this.room._id})}`
<9> After getting all the messages of the chat-room, we set them in a local public array to be accessible to the html template.
<10> In the `ngOnDestroy` method we need to unsubscribe all the subscriptions, remove listeners for `socket.io` events, and emit `leave-chat-room` event so the server can know when a user has left the room. This method is always call whenever the user goes back using the back button.
<11> We emit the `add-message` event with the message text and the room id.

And also `chat-room.html`:

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
include::src/app/pages/chat-room/chat-room.page.html[]
----
<1> we have to go back to `select-room` page instead `home` page
<2> Instead of just showing `Chat` in the header, we now show `Room: <room-name>`.
<3> now we compare `message.owner.nickname` instead comparing `message.from`

Now launch your app and make sure your backend is up and running!

For testing, you can open a browser and another incognito browser like in my example at the top to chat with yourself.
